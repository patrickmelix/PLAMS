.. note::
   The Amsterdam Modeling Suite requires the installation of additional Python
   packages to run the machine learning potential backends.
   You can use the following command to install all available machine learning potentials:

   .. code-block:: sh

      $ "$AMSBIN"/amspackages install mlpotentials
