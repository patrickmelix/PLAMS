Helpers for showing molecules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

   def draw_molecules(molecules: List[plams.Molecule]):
       smiles = [molecule.properties.smiles for molecule in molecules]
       return draw_smiles(smiles)


   def draw_smiles(smiles: List[str]):
       rd_mols = [Chem.MolFromSmiles(s) for s in smiles]
       return Draw.MolsToGridImage(rd_mols)

The ReactionsDiscoveryJob class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

   job = ReactionsDiscoveryJob(name="MyDiscovery")
   driver = job.input
   md = driver.MolecularDynamics

Setting up the reactants for molecular dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

   md.NumSimulations = 4
   build = md.BuildSystem
   build.NumAtoms = 250
   build.Density = 0.9
   build.Molecule[0].SMILES = "O"  # Water
   build.Molecule[0].MoleFraction = 1
   build.Molecule[1].SMILES = "NCCO"  # MEA
   build.Molecule[1].MoleFraction = 2
   build.Molecule[2].SMILES = "O=C=O"  # Carbondioxide
   build.Molecule[2].MoleFraction = 3
   draw_smiles([build.Molecule[i].SMILES.val for i in range(len(build.Molecule))])

.. figure:: reactions_discovery_files/reactions_discovery_7_0.svg

Setting up reactive molecular dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

   md.Enabled = "Yes"
   md.Type = "NanoReactor"
   reactor = md.NanoReactor
   reactor.NumCycles = 10
   reactor.Temperature = 500
   reactor.MinVolumeFraction = 0.6

Setting up network extraction and ranking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

   network = driver.NetworkExtraction
   network.Enabled = "Yes"
   network.UseCharges = "Yes"
   ranking = driver.ProductRanking
   ranking.Enabled = "Yes"

Selecting the AMS engine to use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

   engine = engines.ReaxFF()
   engine.ForceField = "Glycine.ff"
   engine.TaperBO = "Yes"  # This is a really important setting for reaction analysis with ReaxFF potentials
   driver.Engine = engine

Running reactions discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

   result = job.run()  # start the job
   job.check()  # check if job was successful

::

   [11.02|09:43:46] JOB MyDiscovery STARTED
   [11.02|09:43:46] JOB MyDiscovery RUNNING
   [11.02|09:46:16] JOB MyDiscovery FINISHED
   [11.02|09:46:17] JOB MyDiscovery SUCCESSFUL





   True

Obtain the results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

   graph, molecules, categories = result.get_network()

Categories
~~~~~~~~~~

The categories are ``Products`` ``Reactants`` and ``Unstable``, as described in the reactions discovery manual. ``molecules`` is a dictionairy with keys equal to the categories and each concomitant value is a list of PLAMS molecules.

.. code:: ipython3

   print(categories)

::

   ['Reactants', 'Products', 'Unstable']

.. code:: ipython3

   draw_molecules(molecules["Reactants"])

.. figure:: reactions_discovery_files/reactions_discovery_20_0.svg

Products
~~~~~~~~

These are the side products that reactions discovery found in the order as found by the ranking algorithm.

.. code:: ipython3

   draw_molecules(molecules["Products"][:6])

.. figure:: reactions_discovery_files/reactions_discovery_22_0.svg

Unstable
~~~~~~~~

Unstable products were determined to not likely exist outside of reactive dynamics. This e.g. includes radicals or structures that don’t form stable molecules in isolation. Not all unstable molecules have a sensible 2d structure, so instead we plot their 3d structure.

.. code:: ipython3

   for unstable_molecule in molecules["Unstable"][:3]:
       plams.plot_molecule(unstable_molecule);

.. figure:: reactions_discovery_files/reactions_discovery_24_2.png

Graph of the reaction network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The graph is a bipartate networkx DiGraph with reaction and molecule nodes. This can be stored on disk in standard graph formats, e.g. ``.gml``

.. code:: ipython3

   import networkx as nx

   nx.write_gml(graph, "reaction_network.gml")

Load a job not originally run by PLAMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: ipython3

   from scm.plams import FileError

   try:
       job = ReactionsDiscoveryJob.load_external("plams_workdir/MyDiscovery")
       graph, molecules, categories = job.results.get_network()
   except FileError:
       pass
