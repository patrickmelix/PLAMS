Jobs
-------------

.. currentmodule:: scm.plams.core.basejob

The |Job| class is undoubtedly the most important object in PLAMS.
Job is the basic piece of computational work and running jobs is the main goal of PLAMS scripts.

Various jobs may differ in details quite a lot, but they all follow the same set of common rules defined in the abstract class |Job|.

.. note::

    Being an abstract class means that the |Job| class has some abstract methods -- methods that are declared but not implemented (they do nothing).
    Those methods are supposed to be defined in subclasses of |Job|.
    When a subclass of an abstract class defines all required abstract methods, it is called a *concrete class*.
    You should never create an instance of an abstract class, because when you try to use it, empty abstract methods are called and your script crashes.

.. seealso::
    
    The |AMSJob| class handles AMS jobs.

Every job has its own unique name and a separate folder (called the job folder, with the same name as the job) located in the main working folder.
All files regarding that particular job (input, output, runscript, other files produced by the job execution) end up in the job folder.

In general, a job can be of one of two types: a *single job* or a *multijob*.
These types are defined as subclasses of the |Job| class: |SingleJob| and |MultiJob|.

Single job is a job representing a single calculation, usually done by executing an external binary (ADF, Dirac etc.).
Single job creates a *runscript* (which is usually just a shell script) that is then either executed locally or submitted to some external queueing system.
As a result of running a single job multiple files are created, including dumps of the standard output and standard error streams, together with any other files produced by that external binary.
|SingleJob| is still an abstract class that is further subclassed by program-specific concrete classes like for example |AMSJob|.

Multijob, on the other hand, does not run any calculation by itself.
It is a container for other jobs, used to aggregate smaller jobs into bigger ones.
There is no runscript produced by a multijob.
Instead, it contains a list of subjobs called *children* that are run together when the parent job is executed.
Children jobs can in turn be either single or multijobs.
Job folder of each child job is a subfolder of its parent's folder, so the folder hierarchy on the filesystem reflects the child-parent hierarchy of jobs.
|MultiJob| is a concrete class so you can create its instances and run them.



Preparing a job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step to run a job using PLAMS is to create a |Job| instance.
You need to pick a concrete class that defines a type of job you want to run (|AMSJob| will be used as an example in our case) and create its instance::

    myjob = AMSJob(name='myfirstjob')

Various *keyword arguments* (arguments of the form ``arg=value``, like ``name`` in the example above) can be passed to a job constructor, depending on the type of your job.
The following keyword arguments are common for all types of jobs:

*   ``name`` -- a string containing the name of the job.
    If not supplied, default name ``plamsjob`` is used.
    Job name cannot contain path separator (``\`` in Linux, ``/`` in Windows).
*   ``settings`` -- a |Settings| instance to be used by this job.
    It gets copied (using :meth:`~scm.plams.core.settings.Settings.copy`) so you can pass the same instance to several different jobs and changes made afterwards won't interfere.
    Any instance of |Job| can be also passed as a value of this argument.
    In that case |Settings| associated with the passed job are copied.
*   ``depend`` -- a list of jobs that need to be finished before this job can start.
    This is useful when you want to execute your jobs in parallel.
    Usually there is no need to use this argument, since dependencies between jobs are resolved automatically (see |parallel|).
    However, sometimes one needs to explicitly specify such a dependency and  ``depend`` option is meant for that.

Those values do not need to be passed to the constructor, they can be set or changed later (but they should be fixed before the job starts to run)::

    myjob = AMSJob()
    myjob.name = 'myfirstjob'
    myjob.settings.runscript.pre = 'echo HelloWorld'

Single jobs can be supplied with another keyword argument, ``molecule``.
It is supposed to be a |Molecule| object.
Multijobs, in turn, accept a keyword argument ``children`` that stores the collection of children jobs (usually a list or a dictionary).

The most meaningful part of each job object is its |Settings| instance.
It is used to store information about contents of the input file and the runscript as well as other tweaks of job's behavior.
Thanks to the tree-like structure of |Settings| this information is organized in a convenient way: the top level (``myjob.settings``) stores general settings, ``myjob.settings.input`` is a branch for specifying input settings, ``myjob.settings.runscript`` holds information for runscript creation and so on.
Some types of jobs will make use of their own ``myjob.settings`` branches and not every kind of job will require ``input`` or ``runscript`` branches (like multijob for example).
The nice thing is that all the unnecessary data present in job settings is simply ignored, so accidentally plugging settings with too much data will not cause any problem (except some cases where the whole content of some branch is used, like for example the ``input`` branch in |AMSJob|).



.. _job-settings:

Contents of job settings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. important::

    The recommended way of programmatically preparing input for AMS is through  `PISA <../../pisa/index.html>`_.

The following keys and branches of job settings are meaningful for all kinds of jobs:

*   ``myjob.settings.input`` is a branch storing settings regarding input file of a job.
    The way in which the data present in ``input`` branch is used depends on the type of job and is specified in respective subclasses of |Job|.
*   ``myjob.settings.runscript`` holds runscript information, either program-specific or general:

    -   ``myjob.settings.runscript.shebang`` -- the first line of the runscript, starting with ``#!``, describing an interpreter to use
    -   ``myjob.settings.runscript.pre`` -- an arbitrary string that will be placed in the runscript file just below the shebang line, before the actual contents
    -   ``myjob.settings.runscript.post`` -- an arbitrary string to put at the end of the runscript
    -   ``myjob.settings.runscript.stdout_redirect`` -- boolean flag defining if standard output redirection should be handled inside the runscript.
        If set to ``False``, the redirection will be done by Python from outside the runscript.
        If set to ``True``, standard output will be redirected inside the runscript using ``>``

*   ``myjob.settings.run`` branch stores run flags for the job.
    Run flags is a flat collection of key-value pairs that are used by |GridRunner| to construct a command used to submit the runscript to a queueing system (like, for example, number of nodes/cores or size of the memory used with ``qsub`` or ``sbatch``)
*   ``myjob.settings.keep`` and ``myjob.settings.save`` are keys adjusting |cleaning|.
*   ``myjob.settings.pickle`` is a boolean value defining if the job object should be pickled after finishing (see |pickling|)
*   ``myjob.settings.link_files`` is a boolean value defining if files from the job folder can be linked rather than copied when copying is requested



.. _default-settings:

Default settings
++++++++++++++++

Every job instance has an attribute called ``default_settings`` that stores a list of |Settings| instances that serve as default templates for that job.
Initially that list contains only one element, the global defaults for all jobs stored in ``config.job``.
You can add other templates by simply adding new elements to that list::

    myjob.default_settings.append(sometemplate)
    myjob.default_settings += [temp1, temp2]

During job execution, just after |prerun| method is finished, job's own ``settings`` are soft-updated with all elements of ``default_settings`` list, one by one, starting with the **last** one.
That way, if you want to adjust some setting for all jobs present in your script, you don't need to do it for each job separately, one change in ``config.job`` is enough.
Similarly, if you have a group of jobs that need the same ``settings`` adjustments, you can create an empty |Settings| instance, put those adjustments in it and add it to each job's ``default_settings``.
Keep in mind that :meth:`~scm.plams.core.settings.Settings.soft_update` is used here, so a key in a template in ``default_settings`` will end up in job's final ``settings`` only if such a key is not yet present there.
Thanks to that the order of templates in ``default_settings`` corresponds to their importance.
The data from an "earlier" template will never override the data from a "later" one, it can only enrich it.
In the example below::

    s = Settings()
    s.input.ams.Task = 'SinglePoint'
    s.input.ams.UseSymmetry = 'True'
    t = Settings()
    t.input.ams.Task = 'GeometryOptimization'
    myjob = AMSJob(...)
    myjob.default_settings += [s,t]
    myjob.run()

``Task SinglePoint`` from ``s`` becomes replaced by ``Task GeometryOptimization`` from ``t``, but ``UseSymmetry True`` from ``s`` stays and ends up in the final settings of ``myjob``.



.. _job-life-cycle:

Running a job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After creating a |Job| instance and adjusting its settings you can finally run it.
It is done by invoking the |run| method, which returns a |Results| object::

    myresults = myjob.run()

(the |Results| object can be also accessed as ``myjob.results``).
Various keyword arguments can be passed to |run|.
With ``jobrunner`` and ``jobmanager`` you can specify which |JobRunner| and |JobManager| to use for your job.
If those arguments are omitted, the default instances stored in ``config.default_jobrunner`` and ``config.default_jobmanager`` are taken.
All other keyword arguments are collected and stored in ``myjob.settings.run`` branch of job settings, as one flat level.
They can be used later by various objects involved in running your job, for example |GridRunner| uses them to build the command executed to submit the runscript to the queueing system.

The following steps are taken after the |run| method is called:

1.  ``myjob.settings.run`` is **soft-updated** with |run| keyword arguments (so a |run| argument will never override anything already present in ``myjob.settings.run``).
2.  If a parallel |JobRunner| was used, a new thread is spawned and all further steps of this list happen in that thread.
3.  Explicit dependencies from ``myjob.depend`` are resolved.
    This means waiting for all jobs listed in ``depend`` to finish.
4.  Job name gets registered in the job manager and the job folder is created.
    If a job with the same name has been registered before, a new unique name is created.
5.  Job's |prerun| method is called.
6.  ``myjob.settings`` are updated with the contents of ``myjob.default_settings`` (see :ref:`default-settings`).
7.  The hash of a job is calculated and checked (see |RPM|).
    If the same job was found as previously run, its results are copied (or linked) to the current job's folder and |run| method finishes.
8.  Now the real job execution happens.
    If the job is a single job, an input file and a runscript are created and passed to job runner's method :meth:`~scm.plams.core.jobrunner.JobRunner.call`.
    If the job is a multijob, |run| method is called for all children jobs.
9.  After the execution is finished, result files produced by the job are collected and :meth:`~Job.check` is used to test if the execution was successful.
10. The job folder is cleaned using ``myjob.settings.keep``.
    See |cleaning| for details.
11. Job's |postrun| method is called.
12. If ``myjob.settings.pickle`` is set to ``True``, the whole job instance gets pickled and saved to the ``[jobname].dill`` file in the job folder.
    See |pickling| for details


Name conflicts
++++++++++++++

Jobs are identified by their names, so names need to be unique.
This is necessary also because job name corresponds to the name of its folder.
Usually it is recommended to manually set unique names of your jobs (via ``name`` argument of job constructor) for easier navigation through results.
But for some applications, especially the ones requiring running large numbers of similar jobs, this would be very cumbersome.

PLAMS automatically resolves conflicts between job names.
During step 4. of the above list, if a job with the same name was already registered, the current job is renamed.
The new name is created by appending some number to the old name.
For example, the second job with the name ``plamsjob`` will be renamed to ``plamsjob.002``, third to ``plamsjob.003`` and so on.
Number of digits used in this counter can be adjusted via ``config.jobmanager.counter_len`` and the default value is 3.
Overflowing the counter will not cause any problems, the job coming after ``plamsjob.999`` will be called ``plamsjob.1000``.


.. _prerun-postrun:

Prerun and postrun methods
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

|prerun| and |postrun| methods are intended for further customization of your jobs.
They can contain arbitrary pieces of code that are executed, respectively, before or after the actual execution of your job.

|prerun| method is run after the job folder is created but before hash checking.
Here are some ideas what can be put there:

*   adjusting job settings
*   copying to the job folder some files required for the execution
*   extracting results of some other job, processing them and plugging to the current job (for example, extracting optimized geometry from a previous geometry optimization)
*   generating children jobs in multijobs

See also |parallel| for an explanation on how to use |prerun| to automatically handle dependencies in parallel workflows.

The other method, |postrun|, is called after job execution is finished, the results are collected and the job folder is cleaned.
It is supposed to contain any kind of essential results postprocessing that needs to be done before results of this job can be pushed further in the workflow.
For that purpose code contained in |postrun| has some special privileges.
At the time the method is executed the job is not yet considered done, so all threads requesting its results are waiting.
However, the guardian restricting the access to results of unfinished jobs can recognize code coming from |postrun| and allow it to access and modify results.
Thanks to that calling |Results| methods can be safely done in |postrun| and you can be sure that everything that happens in |postrun| is done before other jobs have access to the final job's results.

|prerun| and |postrun| methods can be added to your jobs in multiple ways:

*   you can create a tiny subclass which redefines the method::

        class MyJobWithPrerun(MyJob):
            def prerun(self):
                #do stuff

    It can be done right inside you script.
    After the above definition you can create instances of the new class and treat them in exactly the same way you would treat ``MyJob`` instances.
    The only difference is that they will be equipped with |prerun| method you just defined.
*   you can bind the method to an existing class using |add_to_class| decorator::

        @add_to_class(MyJob)
        def prerun(self):
            #do stuff

    That change affects all instances of ``MyJob``, even those created before the above code was executed (obviously it won't affect instances previously run and finished).
*   you can bind the method directly to an instance using |add_to_instance| decorator::

        j = MyJob(...)
        @add_to_instance(j)
        def prerun(self):
            #do stuff

    In that case, only one specified instance ``j`` is affected with the new |prerun|.

All the above works for |postrun| as well.


Preview mode
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Preview mode is a special way of running jobs without the actual runscript execution.
In this mode the procedure of running a job is interrupted just after input and runscript files are written to the job folder.
Preview mode can be used to check if your jobs generate proper input and runscript files, without having to run the full calculation.

You can enable the preview mode by putting the following line at the beginning of your script::

    config.preview = True


Job API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: Job
    :exclude-members: __weakref__, _result_type



Single jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: SingleJob(molecule=None, name='plamsjob', settings=None, depend=None)
    :exclude-members: __weakref__, _filename



Subclassing SingleJob
+++++++++++++++++++++

|SingleJob| class was designed in a way that makes subclassing it quick and easy.
Thanks to that it takes very little effort to create a PLAMS interface for new external binary.

Your new class has to, of course, be a subclass of |SingleJob| and define methods |get_input| and |get_runscript|::

    class MyJob(SingleJob):
        def get_input(self):
            ...
            return 'string with input file'
        def get_runscript(self):
            ...
            return 'string with runscript'

.. note::

    |get_runscript| method should properly handle output redirection based on the value of ``myjob.settings.runscript.stdout_redirect``.
    When ``False``, no redirection should occur inside the runscript.
    If ``True``, the runscript should be constructed in such a way that the standard output is redirected (using ``>``) to the output file, which name can be accessed as ``self._filename('out')``.

This is sufficient for your new job to work properly with other PLAMS components.
However, there are other useful attributes and methods that can be overridden:

*   :meth:`~Job.check` -- the default version of this method defined in |SingleJob| always returns ``True`` and hence disables any correctness checking.
    If you wish to enable checking for your new class, you need to define :meth:`~Job.check` method in it, just like |get_input| and |get_runscript| in the example above.
    It should take no other arguments than ``self`` and return a boolean value indicating if the job execution was successful.
    This method is privileged to have an early access to |Results| methods in exactly the same way as |postrun|.
*   if you wish to create a special |Results| subclass for results of your new job, make sure to let the job know about it::

        class MyResults(Results):
            def get_some_results(self, ...):
                ...

        class MyJob(SingleJob):
            _result_type = MyResults
            def get_input(self):
                ...
                return 'string with input file'
            def get_runscript(self):
                ...
                return 'string with runscript'

*   :meth:`~Job.hash_input` and :meth:`~Job.hash_runscript` -- see |RPM| for details.
*   if your new job requires some special preparations regarding input or runscript files these preparations can be done for example in |prerun|.
    However, if you wish to leave |prerun| clean for further subclassing or adjusting in instance-based fashion, you can use another method called :meth:`~SingleJob._get_ready`.
    This method is responsible for input and runscript creation, so if you decide to override it you **must** call its parent version in your new version::

        def _get_ready(self):
            # do some stuff
            SingleJob._get_ready()
            # do some other stuff


.. warning::

    Whenever you are subclassing any kind of job, either single of multi, and you wish to override its constructor (``__init__`` method) it is **absolutely essential** to call the parent constructor and pass all unused keyword arguments to it::

        class MyJob(SingleJob):
            def __init__(self, myarg1, myarg2=default2, **kwargs):
                SingleJob.__init__(self, **kwargs)
                # do stuff with myarg1 and myarg2

.. technical::

    Usually when you need to call some method from a parent class it is a good idea to use :func:`super`.
    However, there exists a known bug in Python 3 that causes the ``dill`` package to crash when :func:`super` is used.
    For that reason please do not use :func:`super`.



Multijobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. autoclass:: MultiJob(children=None, name='plamsjob', settings=None, depend=None)
    :exclude-members: __weakref__


Using MultiJob
+++++++++++++++++++++

|MultiJob| can be used in two ways: either by creating instances of it or by subclassing it.
The simplest application is just to use an instance of |MultiJob| as a container grouping similar jobs that you wish to run at the same time using the same job runner::

    mj = MultiJob(name='somejobs', children=[job1, job2, job3])
    mj.children.append(job4)
    mj.run(...)

Such a "container job" can further be customized with :ref:`prerun-postrun`.
For example, |postrun| can be used to collect the relevant data from all children jobs and store it in an easily accessible way in mutlijob's |Results|.

A more flexible way of using |MultiJob| is by creating your own subclasses of it.
That way you can enclose several jobs that are conceptually similar in one convenient "unit", for example:

*   |MultiJob| running a chain of single jobs: take a molecule, preoptimize its geometry using some approximate method, follow with a high-level geometry optimization and then use the optimized geoemtry for some properties calculation
*   |MultiJob| comparing different values of some parameter: run multiple single jobs with the same molecule and settings, but differing in one parameter (for example: XC functional, numerical accuracy, basis set etc.) for the sake of investigating the influence of that parameter on the final results
*   |MultiJob| running different geometries of the same system to investigate some property of the potential energy surface.
    A classic example here would be numerical gradient or numerical hessian calculations.

You can find examples of the above applications (and many more) in TODO: cookbook link.
